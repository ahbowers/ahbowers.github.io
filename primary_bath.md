<h1>primary bath</h1>
<p>I like pretty much everything about this vanity and would be happy to have it in the upstairs or downstairs bathroom.  I like <ul>
  <li>color (I might choose a slightly lighter blue)</li>
  <li>style</li>
  <li>handles</li>
  <li>counter top (Jim was less enthusiastic about the counter top but </li>
  <li>layout of 2 sinks with counter between, though I could be happy with one sink</li>
</ul>
